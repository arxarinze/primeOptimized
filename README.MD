# Decisions

I utilized an algorithm known as the **sieve of Eratosthenes** for calculating the prime,
I actually learnt this algorithm in a course in the university _CSC 202 Data Structure and Algorithms_

- I have utilized typescript with the express framework to create the service that solves the specification:
  - Create a web application that takes in a number and returns to the user the highest prime number lower than the input number
